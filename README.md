Use CPD_demo.ipynb to reproduce the results in paper. 

In CPD_demo.ipynb, use sim_data_s1 to simulate data for Scenario 1. The simulated data will be saved in the data folder.

Use CD_GFL_sim.py to run the algorithm for nodal clustering. The output will be saved in the result folder.

For real data experiments, use CD_GFL_real.py to reproduce the results and use the R codes in the data folder to reproduce the figures.
